                   <h2>Members</h2>
                <p>Links for Membership forms can be found below.  Membership runs until October each year and costs just &#163;25 for seniors and &#163;18 for Juniors.   We also offer non ridden membership at &#163;12.  Keep an eye out for social events and the AGM as well as training and qualifiers. See below for BRS membership benefits.  We are also very excited to confirm discounts at Hougton Hall Upon production of a current membership card you will be able to claim a &#163;2.00 reduction on all Unaffiliated Dressage Tests ridden (so you can ride multiple tests in a day with a &#163;2.00 deduction on each - entry will have to be either by telephone or in person at HH Office), 2 rounds clear round jumping for &#163;7.00 not &#163;10.00, (cards to be shown to steward) and arena hire half hour for &#163;18.00 not &#163;20.00 (arena hire only for the member, not booked on someone else's behalf). All these concessions must be supported by membership card. We feel that these concessions are very generous, and hope that as many members as possible will make use of them.</p>
